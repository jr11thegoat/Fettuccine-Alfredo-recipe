This is my pasta dish recipe. 
Need 1 lb of Fettucine Pasta, 6 Tablespoons of Butter, 1 Garlic Clove(minced), 1 1/2 cups of Heavy Cream, 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, and 2 Tablespoons of Italian Parsley. 
In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook. In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted. Save some pasta water. Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water to make the pasta thinner. Finally, garnish with Italian parsley.
